    <h2> ▼ About</h2>
    <div class="nav-bar" id="about-info" >
      <p class="about"> I was born in Denton, Texas. I am 15 years old and live in Oakland, California.</p>
      <h4>School</h4>
      <p> I am currently a freshman at MetWest High School. At school I take 6 different classes. I take Advisory which is more or less Humanities, History and English with a lot of Ethnic Studies. I preffer to think of this class as homeroom because that is what it feels like to me. I also take Integrated Science 1 which should prepare me for when I take Biology and Chemistry or other sciences. There's also Build, a class about entreprenuership and running your own business. For this class I am working on creating a mobile application called DreamTime with the help of Coach Wolf from CodeNext. I take also take IWT, Independent Work Time, which is a free block where I can do work and complete any homework I have. I take Geometry as well. Then there's Studio Production which is a Laney classs, in the community college. This class is a college class which counts as college credit and art credit. I hope that after taking that class I can get an internship related to film next year. </p>
      <h4>CodeNext</h4>
      <p> I am currently enrolled at CodeNext. CodeNext is a program which empowers youth of Black and Latinx communities with computer science skills and leadership skills. Making the next generation of tech leaders and innovators. I joined this program because I felt that I could use this opportunity to step out of the school enviornment and try something that I was into. At the time I didn't have much experience with STEAM, but I learned that there was so much more I could do esspecially with Computer Science. CodeNext has helped me understand new projects and concepts I didn't know of or think of before and I hope to keep learning more.  </p>
      <h4>Tech</h4>
      <p>I love tech because with tech you can create so many things. I was able to make this portfolio because of tech. Tech has can change the world around you and lead to some interesting inovations. I hope that I can make a difference in this world  with tech. I believe that with tech I could create a website, game or app. But most importantly I can use tech to change my community and make the World a better place. </p>

        <p> The current project I am working on is an app called DreamTime. It is still in development, but much progress is being made. I am building this using android studio and hope to have this released April 19th. We have released a couple of surveys to gather information to help the development of the app. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIHbl1Pnc5mZjxBXEiHNGdecggqNthWQJnBOqAVUhN5tXisw/viewform"> You can take our latest survey through this link.  </a> </p>
