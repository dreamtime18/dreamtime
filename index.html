    <h3 id = "little">A Little about me</h3>
    <p>I was born in Denton, Texas. I am 15 years old. I go to MetWest High School.</p>

    <h3>What I love about tech</h3>
    <p>I love tech because with tech you can create so many things. I was able to make this portfolio because of tech. Tech can change the world around you. I hope that I can make a difference in this world and with tech I could create something like a website, game or app. But most importantly I can use tech to change my community.</p>

    <h3 id = "sports">What I love about Sports</h3>
    <p>Sports can teach you many life skills. Playing sports is healthy and provides physical activity. But sports, unite people together. Even professioanls lose, but sports show you that there are other opportunities in life. I enjoy to watch the Dallas Cowboys because they're from my hometown.
